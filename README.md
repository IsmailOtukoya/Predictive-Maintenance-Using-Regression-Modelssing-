## Project Description
Overview:

This machine learning project focuses on predictive maintenance for industrial machines. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can anticipate machine failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. Predictive maintenance can significantly reduce operational costs and enhance the reliability of industrial processes.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection: We obtained a dataset containing various sensor readings and maintenance records from industrial machines. This dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating our predictive maintenance models.

Data Preprocessing: Before building predictive models, we performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance.

Model Selection: We explored multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to identify the most effective model for predictive maintenance.

Handling Class Imbalance: Given that machine failures are relatively rare events compared to normal machine operation, we addressed class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

Model Tuning: For the selected model, we fine-tuned hyperparameters using grid search to improve its predictive performance.

Validation and Testing: We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The trained model's performance was assessed on the validation set, and the final evaluation was performed on the test set.

Documentation: We generated project documentation to provide insights into the code, model performance, and results. This documentation will serve as a reference for future users and stakeholders.

Model Deployment (Optional): While model deployment is not covered in this project, the selected model can be deployed in a production environment for real-time predictive maintenance if desired.

Dataset Description
Dataset Source:

The dataset used in this project is the "ai4i2020" dataset, which contains data related to industrial machines. It was obtained from an industrial manufacturing scenario and provides valuable insights for predictive maintenance.

Dataset Features:

UDI (Unique Device Identifier): A unique identifier for each machine in the dataset.

Air Temperature [K]: The air temperature in Kelvin recorded during machine operation.

Process Temperature [K]: The process temperature in Kelvin recorded during machine operation.

Rotational Speed [rpm]: The rotational speed of the machine's components in revolutions per minute (rpm).

Torque [Nm]: The torque applied to the machine's components in Newton-meters (Nm).

Tool Wear [min]: The cumulative tool wear time in minutes.

Machine Failure: A binary target variable indicating whether a machine failure occurred (1) or not (0).

TWF (Tool Wear Failure): A binary feature indicating the occurrence of Tool Wear Failure (1) or not (0).

HDF (Heat Dissipation Failure): A binary feature indicating the occurrence of Heat Dissipation Failure (1) or not (0).

PWF (Power Failure): A binary feature indicating the occurrence of Power Failure (1) or not (0).

OSF (Overstrain Failure): A binary feature indicating the occurrence of Overstrain Failure (1) or not (0).

RNF (Random Failure): A binary feature indicating the occurrence of Random Failure (1) or not (0).

Dataset Size:

The dataset consists of a substantial number of machine operation records.

Data Quality:

The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and scale features appropriately for modeling.

Class Imbalance:

There is a significant class imbalance in the target variable, where machine failures are relatively rare compared to normal operation.
This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to develop predictive maintenance models and gain insights into improving industrial machine reliability.
